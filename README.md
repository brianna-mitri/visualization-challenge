# visualization-challenge
Analyze the effectiveness of 9 cancer treatment options and the placebo from a study on mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors.

Analysis includes using Python to create summary dataframes and visualizations such as boxplots, and calculate regression and correlation.

## Files
For the Python scripts to work, the files are expected to be in the following format:
- **data:** contains generated data
    - **Mouse_metadata.csv:** data regarding each mouse's characteristics and treatment given
    - **Study_results.csv:** data recorded throughout the study including timepoints and tumor volumes
- **pymaceuticals.ipynb:** where Python code and written analysis are (under "Analysis")
